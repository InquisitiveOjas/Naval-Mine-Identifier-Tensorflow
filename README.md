# Naval-Mine-Identifier-Tensorflow
This is basically a rock or mine predictor. NMI is used to identify whether an obstacle is a Rock or a Mine on the basis of solar signals bounced or reflected back.     

A naval-mine is a self-contained explosive device placed in water to damage or destroy surface ships or submarines.
Unlike depth charges, mines are deposited and left to wait until they are triggered by the approach of, or contact with, any vessel.
The major use of these underwater mines or naval-mines began in world war 1. 
In world war 2 naval mines destroyed more ships than any other weapon.

This is a very important application. This model can help save a lot  of lives.

Dataset:- In order to train our model we will use Sonar Dataset. It contains 208 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder and a rock at various angles and under various conditions.
